<h2> Features of extension</h2>
As soon as you start the extension, first thing you will notice is, on the right hand side, there will be a small menu, which can be collapsed or not. However, within it, you will be able to use the links to each part of the document. Sort of like a table of content, this is intented to make it easier to navigate through the documentation of github repos.
