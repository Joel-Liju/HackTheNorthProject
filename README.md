<h1> Github Documentation Parser </h1>

This chrome extension gets all the Github documentation headers and conveniently puts them in a side menu for you!

<h1>User Guide</h1>
you have to go to the google://extensions, then enable developer mode. From there, first you have to load unpacked, and select the folder you want to use.</br>
Then you have to go to any github.com, and then only will the extension work.

<h2> Features of extension</h2>
As soon as you start the extension, first thing you will notice is, on the right hand side, there will be a small menu, which can be collapsed or not. However, within it, you will be able to use the links to each part of the document. Sort of like a table of content, this is intented to make it easier to navigate through the documentation of github repos.
